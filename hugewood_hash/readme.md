#  Hugewood Hash

A real-time, open-source consensus mechanism derived from the evolving structure of U.S. law.

This project began as a wedding giftâ€”now it's a public legal time oracle.

##  What is the Hugewood Hash?

The Hugewood Hash is a continuously updating, cryptographically verifiable snapshot of the legal state of the United States. It takes live input from:

- Supreme Court opinions (via CourtListener)
- Federal Register entries (via govinfo.gov)
- Circuit court doctrinal splits (simulated)
- Statutory snapshots (U.S. Code Titles 18 and 26)
- Doctrinal vectors representing key constitutional issues

It then:

- Serializes this information into a canonical input tree
- Hashes it using SHA-512
- Tracks changes between runs
- Saves historical snapshots and diffs for auditability

The result is a time-stamped legal fingerprint: a hash of America, updated in real time.
